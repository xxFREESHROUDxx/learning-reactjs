# learning-reactjs

After taking some time away from the library, I realized that there were many small details that I had forgotten. In order to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field, I have decided to start from the basics again.  I am approaching this challenge with a curious mindset, eager to explore new concepts and techniques and strengthen my understanding of React JS.

## What I will be learning:

* Class and Functional Components
* JSX
* Props and State
* Component Life Cycle
* React Router
* React Forms
* Redux
* React Redux Form
* Server Side Communication

I will be doing some projects as well to get a better understanding which will help me to work on real world developement.
